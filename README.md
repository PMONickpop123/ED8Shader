# ED8Shader
This is the "The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel / Sen no Kiseki" shader used in the actual game, but compatible with Unity/VRChat. However, currently it needs to be heavily fixed up and optimized for public use.

General:
The map setting files are located in the games "/data/ops/" folder. These files include information of the maps lighting, effects, loading zones and map objects.
The table files are located in the games "/data/text/dat_us/" folder. "t_name.tbl" has information on the character names which go to what model, as well as their animation file, and facial expressions. "t_place.tbl" has information on map names and what map model it belongs to.
The animation data files are located in the games "/data/scripts/ani/dat_us/". These dat files hold what animations belong to them, as well as have info on the equipment files (EQU) and what bone they get rooted to.
